# CSE211: Algorithms

### Project Topics
- Brute-force cycle detection in graph.
- Dijkstra's algorithm.
- HuffmanAlgorithm(Array Based).
- Longest Common Subsequence.
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree.


### Description
Techniques and principles of algorithms design including divide-and-conquer and greedy algorithms. Complexity (worst and average case) analysis and their associated asymptotic notations (Theta, Big O, Omega). Iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, insertion sort. Recursive sorting: merge sort, quick sort, heap sort. Sorting in linear time: counting/radix sort. Decision tree analysis: N*logN bound on comparison based sorting.  Algorithms for graph problems: Shortest path (Dijkstra), minimum spanning trees (MST algorithms: Kruskal, Prim). Hashing. Discussion on NP-class problems (e.g. Travelling Salesman Problem).

### Prerequisites
CSE 203 + Lab : Data Structure

### Expected Outcome(s)
- Students will learn methods for designing efficient algorithms, evaluating their performance, and ways of establishing precise limits on the possible effectiveness of classes of algorithms
- They will learn standard algorithms for fundamental problems.
